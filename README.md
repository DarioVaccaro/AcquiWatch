# AcquiWatch

A proposed tool that aimed to aggregate M&A data from around the Internet. This project was put on hold because of issues related to monetization and scalability.

## Technologies

AcquiWatch was created using AngularJS with a NodeJS backend and MongoDB Database.
The hosting was provided by Heroku and the database was hosted on mLab.

Data was aggregated from Crunchbase, Techcrunch and others.
